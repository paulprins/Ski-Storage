Grabbing is one of the most common thing appearing in freestyle today. So
know how to. Learn how to hear.

<U>The Steps:<BR>
</U>1)Get you ski that you will be grabbing up to a point where you can reach
it.<BR>
2) Latch on to your ski with your pointer and middle finger (unless in
mittens)<BR>
3) Let go and put your feet down.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<U>Tweaking:<BR>
</U>Really the only difference between a tweaked grab and a grab is that
the tweak looks a TON better. So learn how to. Really all you do is when
you grab onto you ski you pull it up towards you really good. Maybe to the
side. Takes some balls the first couple times but then it gets easier.
