Tail Grabs are pretty lame unless you tweak them out. Remember that cover
of freeze with JP and that X Tail Grab. Yea it's sweet.

<U>The Steps:<BR>
</U>1) Hit the jump.<BR>
2)Bring tails back like a Back Scratcher<BR>
3)Put your hand/s back behind you.<BR>
4)Grab your ski (<A HREF="grab.html">Grab</A>)-Grab on the very end of the
ski. Over the tail<BR>
5)Release grab and level legs.<BR>
6)Land

<U>Tweaking:<BR>
</U>2 ways to Tweak it.<BR>
#1. Bring one ski back and grab the tail and pull all the way to you back.
Then take the other leg and kick it out.

#2. This is the Best one. One of my favorite Tricks. There are 2 ways to
do it. You can take both tails back, Right hand to right tail then push it
out. OR you can do a Iron Back scratcher and then grab the tail. I think
the first looks better.
