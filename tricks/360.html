<P ALIGN=Left>
The 360 is really a standard trick that everybody should have in there bag.
It's one full rotation. For some style do it switch to switch (Fakie to Fakie).
<P ALIGN=Center>
<U>The Steps For a normal 360:<BR>
</U>1)When you approch the jump counter a little more than you normally
would<BR>
(Countering=all this means is turn your shoulders away from the direction
you spin)<BR>
2)When you pop uncounter your shoulders and look over you shoulder for the
landing.<BR>
3)Land. Wasn't that easy.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<U>The Steps For a Switch 360:</U><BR>
1) Come into the jump switch. Look over the opposite spinning shoulder<BR>
(If you spin to the Left. Look over your right. Right look left.)<BR>
2)When you get at the top of the jump pop and then go and look over other
shoulder like a normal 360.<BR>
3)Land Fakie.

<U>360 Grab:<BR>
</U>When you start the spin I like to bring my feet up towards me. Then do
the grab at about 180 maybe a little before. Then land.

<U>360 Cross:<BR>
</U>Kinda intimidating for the first time but all you do is at 180 pinch
your front side toe(If you spin to the left it's your left side. Right is
right side) in. Remember to uncross and then land.<U><BR>

If you still aren't makin it all the way around what you should try is
uncountering faster. Snap you upper body around. The faster that you get
your upper body going the faster you are going to spin.
