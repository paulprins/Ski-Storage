<P ALIGN=Left>
The 540 is uping the 360 a notch. I think it's a totaly rad trick. Since
it's one and a half rotations you either have to land Fakie or take off that
way. Which makes this a cool trick.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<U>The Steps For a 540 to Switch:<BR>
</U>1)When you approch the jump counter a little more than you normally would
for a 360<BR>
2)When you pop uncounter &nbsp;and snap a little harder and look over for
the jump.<BR>
3)now once you see the jump focus on it. That makes landing

<U>The Steps For a Switch 540:</U><BR>
1)Come into the jump switch. Look over the opposite spinning shoulder<BR>
(If you spin to the Left. Look over your right. Right look left.)<BR>
2)When you get at the top of the jump pop and then go and look over other
shoulder like a normal 540.<BR>
3)Look for the landing and land normal.

<U>540 Grab:<BR>
</U>Same as a 3 grab but you just have to set more and snap a little harder
off the jump. Bring your feet up, grab, and put them down.

If you still aren't makin it all the way around what you should try is
uncountering faster. Snap you upper body around. The faster that you get
your upper body going the faster you are going to spin. Also get used to
landing backward or taking off switch if you having problems with that.
