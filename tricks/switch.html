Switch is when you ski backwards. This takes a little getting used to but
after that it really isn't that hard.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<U>The Steps&nbsp;Switch:<BR>
</U>1) Slide around backwards.<BR>
2)Try not to lean forward (uphill) it'll only screw you up when you jump.<BR>
3)Right before you hit the jump look back up hill. Then when you land try
to concentrate on leaning back. yea back. It will help keep you more upright
on your skis.

your feet up, grab, and put them down.
