&nbsp;<B><U><BIG>Stuff you need:</BIG></U></B><BR>
1)Two chairs or a work bench where you can set your skis up with enough room
for the bindings to clear. (skis will be up side down).<BR>
&nbsp;2)A buddy to hang on to the skis for you while you work on them two
beers of his choice (one before the work- one after the work is done
&lt;G&gt;) <BR>
&nbsp;<B>Stuff from to get form the store</B>:<BR>
1)Wax (all temperature would be nice- fluorinated and/or racing is good.)
I forgot what the advantage of fluorinated wax is but it's nice. If I find
out I'll let you know.) wax is spendy but then so is everything else with
skiing! <BR>
2)Plastic scraper- it will be slightly longer than the width of skis and
will have a little notch at one corners for cleaning wax off the edges.<BR>
3)Scotch Brite Pad-the kind used for cleaning pots and pans. You can swipe
one from your mom or girl friend.<BR>
4)gummy stone- a bit spendy for what it is but it will last for years.<BR>
5)Iron- there are one's you can buy right there at the ski shop while getting
the rest of this stuff. They are about $40 but you can use one you have around
the house. (Don't let anyone see you doing it though or else you'll be dead
meat in a heartbeat! But there's a way out of this. It tell you how
<A HREF="shop.html#iron">later</A>!)<BR>
6)Edge Sharpening Tool- Just get one that does 90 degrees. It Should be about
$10-$15.<BR>
7)Brake Holders-These are rubber bands, heavy duty guys to hold the brakes
down. I don't like them too much. I just use my boots. There are flat devices
you can find to lock into the bindings to hold down the brakes - very nice
to have but not necessary. <BR>
8)Newspapers-plenty of them! In the interest of self-preservation, use them!
When you scrape the wax is going to go everywhere! <BR>
All this will probably cost around $40 initially. I know this hurts. That's
a good lift ticket right there! After this it's just the wax to buy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>
<B><U><BIG>Here we go:</BIG></U></B> <BR>
<B>Set up: </B>Get newspapers on the floor. Spread them out good. Set the
chairs. Maybe two, maybe four to support the skis well at the shovels and
tails and also just in front and behind the bindings. Two chairs are enough,
4 chairs very nice so the skis don't flex too much. Get all your tools you
bought spread out and handy to reach. Push down your brakes and hook the
rubber bands from one leg of the brake over the top of the ski to the other
leg. Or just lock in a boot, and leave it there. Put one ski up side down
on the chairs. <BR>
<B>Now ready to start:</B> 1)Set your iron anywhere between silk and wool.
When it is warmed up get out your spendy wax. <FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Now-
this is important</FONT>. holding the iron vertically above the ski at the
tails, push the wax against the iron. The wax will start to drip about 4
or 5 drips per second. Start moving up the length of your ski so you get
to the shovel within 8 to 10 &nbsp;seconds(About 42-50 drops), moving the
iron here and there as you see fit.You will end up with big splotches of
wax here and there all over the base of your ski. This is ok and this is
what you want. If you take longer than 8 to 10 seconds to make this pass
you will have too much wax to scrape, and you will be scraping for 30 minutes
or more, causing you to cuss and fuss and blaspheme my name profusely!<BR>
2)Set the wax aside. Starting at the shovel,lay the iron down on the base
and move in a circular pattern to melt the wax evenly all over the base.
You will feel the wax melt and the iron will become slippery. This tells
you to move on down the ski. Keep doing this until you get to the tail of
the ski.<BR>
3)Starting at the shovel again, do this again, but this time turn the iron
sideways and move slowly down the ski. Set the iron again right on the base
but you don't need any downward pressure. just the weight of the iron will
do. move slowly. You might see a wisp of steam or smoke here and there(This
is ok but if there is a whole bunch just speed up a bit). Move all the way
down the ski to the tail and completely off the tail before you lift the
iron up.<BR>
4)Do this again. Shovel to tail. Then do it one more time. What this does
is open the pores of the base so the wax flows into the pores of the base.<BR>
5)Set the ski aside somewhere. leave the boot in the ski. Repeat this process
with the other ski. Take a break<BR>
6)Let both skis cool for at least 35 minutes. They must be stone cold to
the touch. <BR>
7)Take the 1st ski you worked on and put it back on the chairs. Find your
scraper. Lay it across the base starting at the shovel at an angle so a sharp
edge is against the base. Your buddy will have to hold onto the ski and/or
the chair while you do this. Now, scrape the wax off the ski, pushing as
hard as you can. Do this with one motion until you get to the tail. Grab
all that excess wax and throw it away. Now. Make another pass. And another.
And another. Keep doing this until you make a pass and all you get is a few
whiskers of wax hanging off your scraper.<BR>
8)Using the Scotch-Brite pad lightly rub down the base and also to rub off
the drippings which ran down the sides of your ski. Do this with the other
ski.<BR>
<B>YOUR DONE!</B>
<P>
<B><BIG>Sharpen the edges</BIG></B>- you can do this before or after you
wax. preferably before. Take another break. Assure your buddy you'll do his
skis next. (But make HIM do the work). Ski with boot still in&nbsp;as it
goes back on the chairs. Up side down of course. Grab the sharpening tool
you bought. There should be instructions on the package. <BR>
1)Basically start from the shovel and move down the ski with firm pressure.
You should feel the file doing its thing. Move all the way down and off the
tail. <BR>
2)Flip the tool over so you can to the other side of the SAME EDGE.<BR>
3)Now do this to the other edge of the ski. You should be able to scrape
some finger nail off of your finger if it's sharp enough.<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Very important-</FONT> Get that gummy stone out. You
are now going to DE-TUNE your ski. If you don't do this the ski is going
to act very unpredictably.&nbsp; You'll go for a light turn and you ski will
take off west while you take off east! <BR>
1)Lay the gummy stone at about a 45 degree angle at the curl of the shovel
and rub lightly back and forth from the curl down towards the boot only about
2 inches. This will take about 2 or 3 seconds only.<BR>
2)Do this to the other side of the shovel.<BR>
3)Now do the same with the tails both sides and you're done. <BR>
4)Use your fingernail scrape test. It should be dull in these 4 areas and
shouldn't take off any fingernail material. You're done! Side Note (if you
do this for a beginner skier, bring the gummy stone down about 4 inches on
all sides instead of only 2 inches. This will give them a more forgiving
action to their skis because they haven't learned to react as quickly as
you do.)<BR>
5)Repeat this process with the other ski.
<P>
<B><A NAME="iron">Clean Up</A>:</B>See all the wax on the newspapers on the
floor? Aren't you glad the newspapers are there? Less to clean up and sweep
up! Now the iron is now full of wax which will thoroughly tick off&nbsp;
the owner of the iron. Solution---- Before you turn off the iron lay it down
on 5 or 6 layers of newspapers as padding and leave it there for 2 or 3 seconds.
lift up and set it on another clean section of newspapers for another 2 or
3 seconds. Do this 2 or 3 times. This allows the newspapers to absorb the
wax out of the iron and into the paper!!! Sneak the iron back where you found
it and no one's the wiser! You're home free and you won't have to check to
see if your life insurance is paid up!
<P>
<B>Done Now Read This:</B>All this will be good for about two week-ends of
skiing, maybe three, depending on snow conditions. The more icy and granular
the snow is the more the wax will wear off. it is good to carry a small can
of that fluorinated wax you can buy and keep it with you. This stuff is liquid.
The top of the can is a spongy applicator. Turn it up side down and rub it
on the ski bases. This is good for a few runs. Or in the shop at the lodge
there is always a fish bowl on the counter with some generic wax for about
75 cents. Grab some. If your skis feel sticky just rub some on. Don't worry
about rubbing it down. This will keep you going. Nice to have just in case.
Be sure to clean everything up or you'll never get to do this again within
six counties of your home! Now get some sleep and hit the slopes tomorrow!&nbsp;
Above all - have fun!
