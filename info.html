Here is the Place to learn where and how to do stuff here at SkiStorage.<BR>
To just move around the place, if you haven't figured it out, you just click
on the place you want to go to on the topbar. Then it will show up in this
window. If you still want this window open click
<A HREF="info.html" TARGET="info">here</A> and it will make a new window
with this information in it.

Amature Gallery where you can post pics of you and friends, &nbsp;A Gallery

<B><A HREF="comp.html" TARGET="comp">Midwest Competition</A></B>- Information
with Write ups&nbsp;on competitions around the midwest. This place wasn't
to hot in 99-00 season but in the 00-01 season it'll go off. There will be
a midwest comp schedule posted here and hopefully writeups for every comp
on that list. Write one up if you went to one
<A HREF="http://skistorage.8m.com/midwest/comp/compform.html" TARGET="comp">here</A>.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<B><A HREF="http://skistorage.8m.com/midwest/index.html" TARGET="_top">MidwestAlliance</A></B>- This
is the place for all midwest skiers to unite. The idea behind this place
is to have one place where skiers from the midwest can come and hang out
on the net. There is a forum, Chat room, Comps (same as above), Skier bios
so that you can marvel at all of the midwest skiers and see you on the web,
and next year we'll have hill reviews and such.<BR>
Midwest Skiers check it out.

<B><A HREF="terrain.html" TARGET="main">TerrainPark</A></B>- This Part is
Huge. 5 sections inside and growing. They are a Trick list with definitions
, Pictures, and instruction (I'm gradually adding more Trick instruction
and Pics), The The Jump Guide with explanations on how to hit/Build/Improve
All different types of jumps, Tip Section with skier submitted tips for better
freeriding, a skishop that teaches you how to wax and sharpen your skis,
and last there is the DownLoads with backgrounds, Calenders, and another
cool stuff I can think of to put here. Any Suggestions Email me.

<B><A HREF="nza/newzea.html" TARGET="main">NZA</A></B>(New Zealand Action)-
This section is all about the new school movement to the south of the equator.
Basically in New mexico. I got lots of crazy stuff lined up here. John and
Josh Mezger (guys who run
<A HREF="http://www.nzfreeskier.com" TARGET="nzfc">New Zealand Freeskier
Camp</A>) are basically running this section. They are going to do some write
ups on comps that happen there. Get interviews and Quotes from the people.
Maybe even get some video from this year to me to have put up. I'll be good.
<P ALIGN=Center>
<B><A HREF="article.html" TARGET="main">Articles</A></B>- Read what other
people say about skiing stuff (Gear, Stories, Videos) and write your own.
I'm going to try to get some interviews with people (Video Producers, Skiers...)
and put them here too.
