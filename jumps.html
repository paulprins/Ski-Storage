These jumps aren't good for much. they are the ones that snowboarders seam
to like because they are LAME. They are very easy to make and if big enough
they can be good for spins and some grabs. They are good for some big air.
not much fun.<BR>
<U>How to make them:</U> These are the easiest to make. All you really do
is find a good hill (one that has a good slope and a sloped landing). 1.Then
all you do is make a huge pile of snow. 2.Flatten out the uphill side and
make sure that it slopes upward. 3.Make sure that you pack it down. Then
they are ready.<BR>
<U>How to hit them</U>: You just go right at them and pop if you want to.
Popping will get you a little more distance.<BR>
<U>How to Improve</U>: Make it a <A HREF="jumps.html#kicker">Kicker</A>. That's all
I have to say. See below<BR>

<B><BIG><A NAME="kicker">Kicker</A> (Jump with a lip)</BIG></B><BR>
These jumps are the most common that people make. they are easy and you can
get a lot of air. The only difference between this jump and the one above
is that this one has a lip and will pop you up. That's the reason that people
like them better. You get more air. These jumps are good for every thing,
Inverts, Spins, and Grabs.<BR>
<U>How to make them:</U> Basically they are the same as the normal jump.
Find a good hill. 1. Make a huge pile of snow. 2. Flatten out the uphill
side to your liking and so that it slopes upward. 3. &nbsp;This is where
it changes, You want to add the lip in. I find that if you just carve out
the bottom end of the pile of snow that that works well (see pic below).
Notice that in the picture I didn't met the lip at the very peak. I do this
so that the peak is less likely to fall off. it works very well and it needs
less fixing. This is a little exaggerated but you should get the idea. It
shows how the kicker (blue) is carved out from the launcher(black). Also
shows the top flatended off (good idea for both jumps) to help preserve the
lip.<BR>
The lip is the part of the jump that curves up right at the end and pops
you up in the air. 4. Then make sure it is packed down and hit it. Fix when
needed.<BR>
<U>How to hit them</U>: These are really easy. just set your self and you
don't really need to pop because a good one will pop you up. Just make sure
that your knees do absorb the lip. Pop if you like. You'll get tons of air.<BR>
<U>How to Improve</U>: Just make the lip better and make the top flat if
it isn't. It'll be better and you'll get more air. Just don't over do it.
To much lip and you'll really screw it up. Make it good then leave it.<BR>

<B><BIG><A NAME="table">Table </A>Top</BIG></B><BR>
These are fun. They consist of a front kicker or launcher. Then a &nbsp;landing
a distance away. what makes them fun is that they are filled in between.
They are great for every thing. Inverts, Spins, and Grabs. They are my second
favorite only to the next hit down the list.<BR>
<U>How to make them</U>: You don't make them. It would take to long. Most
of the time terrain parks will have them and will keep them in good shape.<BR>
<U>How to hit them</U>: Just hit them like you would depending on if it is
a launching table or a table with a kicker. So just read what it says about
how to hit either of those to. Also the first hit. have more speed than you
think you'll need. to make sure that you will clear the flat on the top.<BR>
<U>How to Improve</U>: Don't. Unless they really suck then just do what it
says for the <A HREF="jumps.html#kicker">Kicker.</A><BR>

These are my Favorite. These are the same as the table but the middle isn't
filled in. They are good for everything. The reason that they are my favorite
is because you hit them you get this feeling like your so high up and can
do anything. It is also the most fun to watch. it is great to see people
come in short. HAHA they smack right into the landing.<BR>
<U>How to make them</U>: Just put your kick up then make a launcher facing
back wards however far away you want. Then hit it. Fix it when needed.<BR>
<U>How to hit them:</U><I> </I>Just get your speed and go for it. what ever
you do don't wimp out or you'll come in short.<BR>
<U>How to Improve</U>: Now if your clearing it fine leave it alone. But if
your going to far put a little bit more of a kick on it. If you can't seem
to make it then take some snow and fill in the lip a little bit to make it
launch you more than kick you up. Once you&nbsp;get it good your golden.<BR>

<B><BIG><A NAME="step">Step</A> Up</BIG></B> <BR>
Really that is all it is. It's a jump where the lip is lower that the landing.
So when you hit the jump you have to step up to the landing area. They are
just ok but you really can't do much off of them. They also look kind of
funny. Because the landing is up higher than the take off.<BR>
<U>How to make them</U>: If you really want to you just make a kicker with
a good lip. Then a landing (backwards launcher) that is bigger than the kicker.
So that the landing is up higher than the take off.<BR>
<U>How to hit them</U>: Just go for it. Pop off the top and go over. Might
be good for a japan or something.<BR>
<U>How to Improve</U>: This is the best part. tear the landing down and put
in a <A HREF="jumps.html#gap">gap jump</A>. They are way better and you actually do
so cool tricks off of it. Just look up one and do what it says.<BR>

<B><BIG><A NAME="spine">Spine</A></BIG></B><BR>
I haven't really hit that many of these but they are kind of fun. What they
are is a hit that goes into a ridge type thing. Then you land on one of the
sloping down sides. They have the chance of being very versatile because
you can land any where along the actually spine. These are good for grabs.
but inverts could be possible. I would not do spins on it because you land
on the side and depending on which way you spin you might hit the top ridge
and fall.<BR>
<U>How to make them</U>: These are fairly easy. 1. build a kicker. 2. Make
a huge Long pile of snow going strait back from the jump. 3. Make the actually
spine with it come to a point near the center of the jump. 4. Make sure that
it is all packed down.<BR>
<U>How to hit them</U>: These are the easiest to hit i think. &nbsp;All you
do is when your coming up to the jump you pick the side that you want to
land on. Pop if you want to. Do you trick and land.<BR>
<U>How to Improve</U>: You really can't do to much to improve it. If your
over shooting the landing you can make the spine part longer. You can back
the lip bigger or smaller. That's really all you can do. <BR>

<B><BIG><A NAME="half">Half </A>Pipe</BIG></B><BR>
These are very cool. They are so easy to spin in. I could to 3's in here
way before out of the pipe. You can tell if it is a half pipe because it
looks like a half of a pipe or a big round ditch in the ground. These are
great for everything. But to make you even cooler in the pipe you need to
do runs. Where each hit is different. It makes you look better and one of
the cool things about the pipe is that it all fits in a smaller area. So
every one can see you get you 15 hits in one run if you play the pipe right.
If your place doesn't let you in get a bunch of friends and just drop in.
Who really cares. Tell them that you pay the same amount as the snow boarders
and you want the same amount of terrain.<BR>
<U>How to make them</U>: Are you crazy. If you are going to make a pipe you
should know how and i don't think you will be building one in your back yard
or something. If you want to hit one go to a place (ski hill) with one.<BR>
<U><A NAME="ridepipe">How to hit them</A></U>: They are a little intimidating
at first. This should help you out. I would have you take a strait run through
the pipe. Now that doesn't mean you right down the middle. It means that
you take a run though the pipe not doing any tricks but just working the
pipe going back and forth and getting air. The best way to hit the pipe is
this. You want to use you edges in the pipe when you go up the side walls.
The pipe is really a lot like normal jumps. When you get to the top you have
to pop other wise you will leave the pipe and fall on your ass. The idea
is to land as high up the side of the pipe that you can with out hitting
the top edge of the pipe. landing high up will give you more speed and let
you get more air down the pipe. When you drop in the pipe you don't want
to hit the top edge. If you just drop strait in your fine but if you come
over from one side and need to go over the top edge you need to hop over
it. If you don't you will round it off and make it hard for people behind
you to ride the pipe correctly. That's all.<BR>
<U>How to improve</U>: Just leave it alone. There are special Groomers (Pipe
Dragons and such) that are designed to cave it out. They leave the top edge
and the walls very well. So if it really sucks just go yell at someone in
the ski patrol area. <BR>

<B><BIG><A NAME="quarter">Quarter</A> Pipe</BIG></B><BR>
They are pretty easy to spot out. They are just a huge wall that you see
people going up and down. These are totally cool I would say that they are
even better that the half pipe if you are only doing one trick. Because you
can take however big of a intro to the jump that you want. Getting as much
air as you want. If you ever &nbsp;watch a movie and see some skier airing
it huge out of a pipe chances are that it is a quarter pipe (But not always).
All of the Flag shots from High North are on a quarter pipe. They are good
for every thing just like the half pipe.<BR>
<U>How to make them</U>: Well I really don't know. All I would say is get
a huge ass pile of snow and work from there. And you want Vert on it. what
that is a vertical section on the top end of the pipe that makes it so you
land back inside. All good pipes have some vert.<BR>
<U>How to hit them</U>: Fairly simple. There are 2 way to do it. Run right
into it and go for maximum height. or if it is wide you can come in at an
angle and keep your edge in and ride it like a half pipe. But it is best
to be rodd right into it for the hight. just make sure that you don't land
on the jumping part when you come down. Float a little in either direction
to make sure that you don't.<BR>
<U>How to improve</U>: Again leave it alone. But if you really must improve
here a a couple things. If it is hard to stay in add more vert. If you feel
like there is to much vert take some out. you can always make the curve into
the jump a little nicer so that if you fall out of it it won't hurt as
much.<BR>

Well I think that i got them all. I will be updating this sometime soon with
actual pictures of the hits. But till then This is it. I also might do some
short write ups on rails and boxes.
