    Always know where you are going when you get off the lift. Not only is it
    stupid to stand around and figure it out on the top of the mountain. But
    your on the chair for around 5-10 minnets why not do it then.

    Stretch out. You probably think that it is a waist of time but really it
    isn't. What would you rather be doing at the end of the day. Sitting in your
    room acing and sore or out hitting the clubs with buds and chicks. Well if
    you don't stretch your body will tense up more that if you do stretch. Don't
    bounce when you strech though. You could pull a legiment and not even know
    it.

    When skiing anything intimidating (Steeps, Big jumps, Big Tricks, Cliffs,
    Glades) Don't wimp out. If you do you'll most likely hurt your self. When
    your going for your flair you can't lose it. You'll land on your head. So
    get up the guts and just go for it. Think how cool it will look when your
    done.

    <P ALIGN=Center>
    If you think that you'll kill yourself doing some thing DON'T. It's your
    body's way of saying I'm not ready for it. You can get your self ready for
    it just by pumping your self up for it. Or if your worried about not doing
    some thing right. Try it out some where. Back to the Flair example. If you
    don't think you'll get high enough out of the pipe. Take a run down it and
    see for your self if you'll make it.

    If your buddy is scared to do sumthing call him names. example: "Hit the
    fucking jump u pussy" My freind Drew does this alot for me and it works.
    Always challenge each other to go bigger and better.-

<B><BIG><BIG>Just a Story. If you every thought of coming in slow to a
jump</BIG></BIG></B>
<P ALIGN=Center>
One day I went for a nice jump (about 30 years ago). On the approach I got
a bit apprehensive so I checked my speed just a tiny bit. Big mistake! Big
time! When I lifted off I saw that there was a deep gully and another smaller
jump immediately after it. You've seen those kind, right? Dumb way to make
a jump! Anyways, if I had been going the right speed I would have cleared
the second jump with ease. As it was, here I am half way through the air,
and seeing the second jump, my brain is going 'oh shit!' and I land right
on the crest of the second jump in the boot area of my skis. Actually I think
I was slightly before the crest. My skis came to a screaching halt (talk
about ski brakes!) and I came out of my skis. My left ski released a bit
too late. I did a face plant about 30 feet farther. Yard sale all over the
hill. There were some girls around the area who yelled if anything was hurt.
I said, "Nothing but my pride!" They laughed. A moment later I noticed a
pain in my groin. I had pulled a groin tendon. To this day I can somewhat
feel it. So I always try to remember to strech out.

<B>Moral of the story:</B> 1) Have a spotter to make sure what it looks like
behind the jump and that there are no little ones tanning themselves there.
2) Your advice- when you go for it, go for it big time.
