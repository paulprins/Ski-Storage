This is a cool mag and it is in it's 28th year. They always seem to have
good articles and great pictures. Roy Will is in the September 99 issue.
For a while I was a little mad at powder because I thought that they were
drifting from what New School really is but I got the new issue and I know
that they haven't. They have the Shot in The Back, Light and Dry, Little
Areas that Rock, Shooting Gallery, Dueling Banjos where they debate stuff,
the letter are always great, And the most amusing part is Up to Here. It
is a great mag and is defiantly worth the $4.99

Well this is the magazine of the revolution. It's in it's 4th year and has
watched skiing evolve. It is the best magazine that I subscribe to. Inside
you'll find yard sale (this always looks like it hurts), Junk mail, Ask Brad
(where Brad Holmes does funny stuff and answers questions), Th Mountain Profile,
Crud, Stunt of the Month, and the Freezer. I love getting it. I sit down
and read the whole thing right when I get it. I has some of the coolest pictures
and Actually has picture sequences of cool tricks. There was an article with
Tyler Bristol and Roy Will. It was sweet. They were clearing a 90 ft gap.
It sounded sick. This is just a cool mag to read over and over again. And
it's a dollar cheaper than Powder. It is defiantly worth it.

This is the mag for want to be new schoolers. I got the first 2 issues. There
lay out is ok and it is kind of funny but I don't see how it has to do with
the new school. It has some funny tricks in it like the Sudam Husain and
other stuff like that. It goes and picks on what is happening in the world.
Like the LDC one purpose tool. It's got some good pictures in the epics.
They do good product reviews and other stuff like that. It is a little more
geared to mogul skier I think (I'm a gs racer). But it isn't all that bad.

I don't really like this mag. I think that it is more geared to old people.
When it talks about resorts it is more about the hotels. I does have an
instruction section but I found that it didn't help me at all. Well that
is all that I have to say.
