<FONT COLOR="#ff0000">Note</FONT>: This is a place to tell about stupid stuff
that you've seen other skiers do or ask. You could write about your self.
It would be funny. But I don't think that you would. So if you see some retard
bail out over a table and land on his head and break his rental skis.<BR>
Write it up <A HREF="../articalform.html">here</A>. Thanks.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One day I was sitting out side at lunch talking to some
of my friends when this guy comes up to me. He is acting all woried and asks
me if I'm some what ski smart. I say yes. Then the guys starts telling me
about how he just got his first pair of skis with a sidecut on them and he
is going over every ting about his skiing. He tells me that he is taking
chunks out of his skis and he can't figure out why. So I ask him how he stands
and he shows me that he stands with he feet right next to each other. I said
that whats probably happening is that his outside skis is over turning and
scrapig his inner ski. But then he goes on to reinform me that there are
huge chuncks out of his NEW $600 skis. He wants to know if it will ruin his
skis. I said that I didn't think so. Then he left.<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was happy that he was finaly gone and started to talk
to my friends again. We were already ripping on this guy but then he came
back. He had his NEW $600 skis with him this time. He goes on to show me
that his skis had huge chucks taken out of them. By now I'm thinking that
he has to be the most retarded person in the world. He pulls his skis apart
and then shows me the horible scraches on his skis. I was trying hard not
to laugh. The guy had like 4-5 little scraches on his skis. In one spot it
had scraped the topsheet particly off. I told the guy that his skis would
be fine Then he asked what to do about the core showing so i told ihm not
to worie (It wasn't even core. Just the white layer under the topsheat).
He said, "Thanks, Now if I only knew how to use them." People like this have
always pissed me off. The go and buy the kick ass $900 gear and can't even
ski, but I guess I've changed because I was laughing at this guy.
