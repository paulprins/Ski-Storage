Minnesota - Hyland Hills
<P ALIGN=Left>
Snow Bird is my favorite resort. I'll tell you why. The place is just awesome.
They have the best powder that I have ever skied in my whole life and lots
of it (About 500 inches). It is as steep as you could ever want with huge
cliffs and natural kickers all over. I hit this one kicker and got launched
at least 40 or 50 feet. I didn't get a chance to go i the pipe or the Terrain
Park last season so I couldn't tell you what those are like. Last year I
hooked up with some snowboarders who knew the place front and back so that
really helped. This season they open up the back side and it looks very
promising. So if you have the chance head out to utah and ski the bird.

Minnesota - Hyland Hills
<P ALIGN=Left>
Alta is just up the cannon from Snow Bird. It gets a little more snow every
year than snow bird. About 500 inches. The place is huge. I still haven't
skied the whole thing. And it is pure old school. No high speed lifts, No
terrain park, No halfpipe, Just good old fashion skiing. If your in the mood
for untracked powder head over here. With a little looking you can find some
fresh stuff. It's tons of fun and there are a lot of cliffs to drop off of
so be ready.

Minnesota - Hyland Hills
<P ALIGN=Left>
&nbsp;Well this is my home hill. That's really all that it is. A hill. But
for me it is more than enough. There park is pretty cool. One of the
best&nbsp;ones around the cities I&nbsp;think. They've even had a quarter
pipe this year so far. They do have a&nbsp;pipe dragon or something like
it so Now finally they will let skiers in the pipe. I can't wait for that.
I've hit it before but it was nothing special. Now there will be something
worth getting your self over there for. Now if you are in the mood to carve
some turns than hyland really isn't for you. If you&nbsp;are there you are
either learning how to&nbsp;ski or you&nbsp;are In the park or pipe. Unless
your on a team. That is where

Minnesota -&nbsp;Welch Village
<P ALIGN=Left>
Welch Village is nestled in the Red Wing river valley 25 miles east of Highway
52. They offer better skiing than any other areas in the south-eastern corner
of Minnesota. This year they bought a Pipe Dragon and got a halfpipe started.
Nothing to talk about yet...not big enough to do anything. I'm hoping
though...that they will get it in good shape pretty soon.

Minnesota - Hyland Hills
<P ALIGN=Left>
Well this is one of the better resorts in minnesota. They have a good number
of runs. The place is kinda far from the city. maybe 40-45 minuets. They
didn't have a park last year but I hear that they are making one this year.
The main reason to go there is that it has some really good MIDWEST skiing.
good runs. Not crowded. Just a good place. and there Actually is some steep
stuff and they normal have a bump run or two.

Minnesota - Hyland Hills
<P ALIGN=Left>
Well buck hill is bigger than hyland so you can actually turn on that hill
but for the park and pipe. Sorry skiers but it isn't skier friendly. I went
over there last year and Got chased out of there. They clipped my ticket
once just for heading for the tow rope next to the halfpipe. But this year
I hear that they are having a Bigger terrain park. That skiers can use but
the pipe is still off limits. Over all i wouldn't go there unless you live
right there.

Oregon - Mt.Hood Area
<P ALIGN=Center>
Built during the depression in the 30's. Dedicated 1937 by Roosevelt on the
same day he dedicated Bonneville Dam. (busy guy that day!) It was a CCC and
WPA I think project to get people working again. There were a lot of voluteers
too. Beautiful lodge!&amp;nbsp; Skiing- Puche (pronounced 'poochie) a blue
run with a couple of off shoots of short blacks and a green. Victoria Station-
nice long run I would call a high level blue with a couple of short black
off shoots back to Puche. You can kick up some decent speed on this one.
Not too many people (kiddies) on it. Puche you gotta watch it. kiddies, classes
and boarders sitting all over the place. Magic Mile- mile long run. lower
level blue, very wide. Very wide- can go as fast or as slow as you want.
Good place to take beginners and inters. Silcox Lodge is at the top of Magic
Mile. Good place to have lunch. Yuo can reserve the place for weddings and
even stay there but the waiting list is long. It's an historic site. Small,
rustic, and gorgeous inside... right out of the 30's! Palmer- higher up than
the Mile. Some call it a low level black. I call it a high level blue.

Oregon - Mt.Hood Area

Mt. Hood Meadows- good place to ski. good runs. good moguls in places.One
face always is full of moguls. Many moons ago I took the face aftera season
of advanced lessons. My timing was perfect! I was looking likethe guys in
the videos and movies! I remember my brain starting to pumpmy ego. That's
when I lost it; not paying attention to looking ahead. hit the back side
of a mogul, not paying attention to my line, double flip, landed on my back,
yard sale time! The lift close by had stopped and all the people I noticed
were leaning forward trying to find out if I was ok. So without getting up
I lift my hands and arms to the sky and yell, "God! Why me?" Everyone laughed.

Oregon - Mt.Hood Area
<P ALIGN=Center>
First ski area on the mountain. Upper bowl and lower bowl and outback. I
haven't skied the outback. My skis are too thin. I'd sink like a rock. Upper
bowl was the steepest place in the world to ski (commercially developed)
in 1937 or so. Short run but nice. Also the largest night skiing area in
the nation. At the top of the upper bowl you can take beginners around the
ridge on a green run! This way they can actually see what a black looks like
going up the lift, without having to take the black run. Ski Bowl is lower
on the mt. so the snow is wetter sometimes.

100 some odd miles from Portland. Very dry snow. good powder. Great area
to ski if you don't mind the crowd of cocky bastards.
