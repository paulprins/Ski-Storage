When I first got this movie I thought that It was cool. It has got a lot
of New School skiing. Some good footage of tahoe ,the summer X-games, and
Ritsganson, Sweeden. They all so have a ton of Freeskiing, from alaska to
Canada and all the way to France and Italy. I wasn't quite into the whole
new school stuff when I got it but now I almost never watch it. The clips
are just ok but they are spaced out to much.

Well I hope that you've heard of this one. It is the second video made by
Jonny D. This is going to be one of those ski movie classics. If you don't
already own it I want to know why. The cast is the NCAF, Mosley, Loubek,
and tons more. There are some of the sickest tricks in the book. I've watched
it so many times (well over 150) that the Audio isn't working right anymore.
They got some great film from Japan, summer camp up at Whistler, some great
mogul footage, Mark McDonald has his own section and he rips (almost stuck
a 1440), Mike Douglas well enough said. This is the best ski movie of 1998
and it is for a reason.

This is the 97-98 movie by Mike Crichton. It is a little bit more towards
mogul that ruckus is. But it is still a rad movie. They aren't going as big
but the airs are still sick. Some of the tricks are, Double Back, Back 360,
Lots of 360 mutes, and tons more. If you get Ruckus I would get this one
too (he'll even put them on the same tape for you). It was fun to watch them
back to back and to see how they got better. You could see Tanner, Westerlund,
Cusson, Auclair, Dorion, and the Crichton's. Now just because you haven't
heard of them doesn't mean anything. They rip it up. I would get this one
with Ruckus.

This is the 98-99 movie made by Mike Crichton and his Family. It is also
one of the best movies that I have seen. It's got tons of people. Great Mogul
Footage and is just a great movie. It is mostly of the Crichton family and
they rip it up. They throw down Lincoln loops, Misty's, 360 mute japan's,
Backflip mutes, 720's, 1080's, and I think there is a 1440 but I'm not sure,
Some great flairs in the pipe. But the best part is the Wipeouts section.
It kicks. It has to be one of the best. And the movie is cheap too. This
is one that you have to own. When you get it I would also get Memories. He'll
put it on the same tape and save ya a cupple bucks.

This movie kicks. It's nice to see whats going on in one section of the country.
It's got everyone in it from the squaw posse, Shane Anderson, Trevor Ramois,
Jamie Burge, Gravy, June Ido, and more guys who rip. They got shots from
Donners Pass (the famous road gap), Bunch of big mountain skiing, along with
some good old jibing (notice the old. If you want an all jib movie this isn't
for you). But there are some down sides. The humor is lame. Some guy getting
drunk, a guy trying to be funny as a stalker was lame(crackers). It would
have been funny if he would have gone around breaking stuff. But the credits
were good. The cat makes me smile. It is an all around good movie and is
worth getting if your excepting of the sport. The attempt at funnyness just
don't work with me.
