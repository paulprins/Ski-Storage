The Spy Snowscoops are the best goggles I have ever had. They are cofortable
as hell. Ive only had them fog up a couple times. Plus there are so many
frame/lense combinations you can get exactly what you want. The other cool
thing is they look sick as hell. I definatley recomend geting these. Diff
frames cost diff amounts of money. They range form $60-100

I got some kickin goggles. They have't foged up on me yet. they have great
optical view. and they fit into my helmet very well. the platinum lens is
the best. It works well during the sunniest day and dark nights. I would
recomend them.

I had the A-frame goggles. They were sweet. Great style and side to side
view length. Blocked light pretty well but one time I got snow on them at
lunch and when I went to wipe out the inside and some coating came out with
it. I was pissed. This was the second time Oakley had screwed me. I thought
that it might have just been fog but it wouldn't come out. I brought them
back to REI where I got them and they gave me my money back. That was the
last chance that I gave oakley.

Well what can I say. I don't like oakley at all. I got a pair of eye jackets.
And they broke. They were the 2nd pair of sunglasses I have ever had. They
were really cool but One time when I was taking them out of the bag the frame
busted. For all of you with Oakleys if you take the Arms off and look at
the main frame you see the pins that hold the arm on. both of those broke
off my Glasses. It pissed me off. So as you can tell I'm not to happy with
them. I brought them back and the guy at the place where I got them said
that it had been happening a lot lately. So that was strike 1 of 2 for oakley.

These are the sun glasses that I currently use. They kick. I have the sliders
and they're red. I love them. They went backpacking with me in new mexico
and I can't wait to try them out skiing. I've used them mountain biking and
they work pretty well. They have interchangeable lense. They come with Orange,
Yellow, and Brown. They are very easy to change and are a good fit to my
face. I love them.

Well I don't remember these that well but I remember that they ruled. I had
the swingers. I wish that I still did. they were great for skiing. Some jerk
stole them from me. That sux but it could have been worse(like me skis).
They did a great job blocking sun but let wind through(like all glasses).
But I would get another pair.
