This is the ski that I'm currently using. I got it for when I go racing.
This is the best ski that I've ever owned. I love it. It works well at high
speeds and floats pretty well in the pow. I ski on the 173 (98-99 model)
and it's also great in the park. It isn't to good in the bumps because it's
go a side cut and looks just ok. But I would recommend this ski to someone
any day.

Well every one knows about this ski. It is one kick ass ski. It is sweet
in the park. I think that the tail is kinda soft but it is a solid ski. Out
of the park it works very well. The can carve very well. Handle ice good
and are just like most all mountain skis. But back to the park. They spin
good. Look cool. They are kinda heavy. If your looking for a park only ski
I would go for the next ski down.

I'll tell you that these are the best skis for the park. Yes even better
than the 1080. They are symmetrical and center mounted. both of them have
there advantages. The center mount makes spinning really easy. They are lighter
than the 10's probably just because they are shorter. When you first put
them on they feel really short because there is almost no ski in front of
the boot compared to what I'm used to. They are super easy to land switch
on and that also means easy to ski switch (easier on tens). But over all
I would say that they are a better ski. and for the $315 they are worth it.
But out of the park. THEY SUCK. These are a pipe/park only ski. They are
hard to get an edge in. They are really flimsy at higher speeds. But if your
a park bum and that's all you would use them for. Get them. (note mine did
break the first day on them. But the said it was bad glue and it makes sence.
It wouldn't keep me from them)
