&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, Sonny! Back when I was your age we alked
to school... 5 miles, uphill, both ways... in 5 ft of snow... in the heat
of July! Oh! sorry! Forgot to take my Viagra and prozac! bwahahaha<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Winter of 56-57, 5th grade. I didn't give a rip about
girls, just skiing, or learning how to. (I had it bad!) I had a fever the
night before. This was because I was so excited in going. Mom said I wasn't
going if the fever wasn't down by morning. You never saw a kid hit the sack
so fast! The next day I was on my way to Mt. Hood Ski Bowl to learn how to
ski. A bus load of screaming kids arrives and we all pile out to the back
of the&nbsp;bus to get our skis, which are all piled on top of each other.
Solid wood skis long enough to reach from the ground to the first knuckle
on your longest finger, standing straight with your arm stretched skyward
as high as possible. Some of us had the newer metal poles. Some had the standard
bamboo poles. The poles had metal rings for baskets which were attached by
leather straps to the pole itself. All skis by this time had metal edges.Most
came in sections so if a part of the edge got hit or bent you could buy another
section (8" or so) and screw it in place. When metal edges first came on
the scene it was considered cheating and unfair advantage. Sounds like some
guys today. (The more things change, the more they remain the same).<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had bear claw bindings and was told to get new
bindings fast. I got something that looked like a flat, but wavy piece of
metal with a dimple in it and a metal piece with a bump on it which was screwed
into the toe of my boots. This fit into the dimple. We all still had the
cable which you hooked around a groove in the heel of your boot, and then
you threw the lever forward or backward, which ever the lever action was
for that binding. You had metal cable guides along the sides of your skis
for the cable! Some of us even repositioned the farthest back guide further
back in order to get a more downward pull on the heel &nbsp;to keep the heel
from lifting up so damned much. One girl in our class had one of the new
safety bindings from Marker, "SkiFree". <BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Boots were great. About 350 different makers. Some even
had an inner boot also made of leather. Us cool dudes made neat lacing patterns
while lacing up our boots. This took place about 20 minutes before you got
to the ski area. End of the day always saw your feet soaking wet. That's
why you always brought an extra pair of socks and a towel. Your boots always
went back into the boot tree, if you could con your folks into buying one
for you. This would clamp down on your boot with wingnuts to keep the toe
from curling up like an elve's sandal!!! <BR>
Instructors seemed to have the best stuff. SkiFree bindings or the like with
long leather straps which you wrapped around your boots which ended up in
a clamp type buckle. This looked cool and important! The rest of us had nothing.
When your ski came off in a fall-which rarely happened... (yeah, right),
The ski would take off downhill seeming to scream, "I'm free! I'm free! Long
live liberty!" When it happened to someone else it was always a good excuse
to yell,"Runnaway ski!" And we all would take off after it. It was a good
excuse to go hell bent for election downhill after it and go as fast as we
could. Of course we didn't have a snowball's chance in hell catching the
damned thing, but it was a good excuse to go fast. This tended to piss off
the ski patrol who warned us many times to stop it or he'd pull our tags!
(You just had to watch out for thsoe ski patrol guys. If you didn't see any....
Go for it!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At Ski Bowl between upper bowl and lower there was a
small hut where you could get lunch and get warm. Today it is an historical
landmark (makes ya feel old!) They call it a warming hut. No burgers, no
fries, just fancy foo-foo drinks like Italian ices, beer, chips. Yuppie food!
Yechhhh!<BR>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Chair lifts were great! Wooden towers, single chairs,
got caught on one for 2 1/2 hrs. during a storm once. Upper bowl had a double
chair! But none of us was good enough to do the upper bowl. it's so steep
it is called the "Back Wall". That's it for now. More stabs from the past
for another time. Bob
