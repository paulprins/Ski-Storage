	How did you get into ski video making/filming?<BR>
	we wanted to change the face of ski videos, as in we thought the average

    <TR>
      <TD>Why do you make ski videos?<BR>
	mostly for fun, but we started freedom specifically to make ski videos more
	asseccible (spelled wrong) to the avergae skier who doesn't get to ski in
	alaska or even out west for that much
	<P>
	Who is your favorite person to film and why?<BR>
	we like filming eric kohl, because when he falls he throws all his shit
	<P>
	Can you tell us anything cool that will happen in your next flick?<BR>
	one word, ghetto. we're going to have a ghetto section with kids jumping
	driveways, cars, off houses, and other shit. mind you most of this is also
	done with less then 1 foot of fucking snow on the ground.</TD>

      <TD>How many copies of your latest video have you sold?<BR>
	maybe 130. that doesn't matter though. if we were in for the money we would've
	charge more than $10.
	<P>
	How do you deside who to put in your video?<BR>
	if they send us footage, they get put in the video
	<P>
	What do you think of Midwest New Schoolers?<BR>
	it's a cool scene, but some of these gapers need to learn how to actually
	turn and if they really want to be impresive, ski powder.</TD>

Next Years Video-<BR>
yo! we're dope and shit. seriously though, this years video is going to be
drastically different from last year. the editing is going to be better,
more involved. the music is going to be less cheesy as well (sorry). the
premise of the video however will be the same. we want to make a video that
is going to fun to watch, showcaese unknowns, and all skiers will be able
to relate to.
