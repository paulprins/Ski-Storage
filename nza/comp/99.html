Another fantastic season of Southern Hemisphere riding culminated on the
2nd of October, at both the Cardrona and Treble Cone (TC) ski fields. This
season saw a number of firsts at TC including, a skier/boarder Slopestyle
on the 6th of August and a skier/boarder Supercross on the 7th. These events
were unique in that it was the first time that the two disciplines were run
during the same event at TC.
<P>
August 6th Slope Style
<P>
The Slopestyle was a huge success! With a total of 25 athletes competing
and ranging in ability from young beginners to world class riders set the
stage for a fun filled day of intense competition combined with a strong
sense of camaraderie. A large Japanese contingency was a major factor in
making the event a success.&nbsp;After registration the riders were given
45 minutes to familiarize themselves with the "hits" and then New Zealand
Freeskier Camp coaches Josh Loubek and Marc McDonnell foreran the course
throwing a slew of rodeo 720's, misty flips, mute grabs, and impressive switch
back flips. The crowd of about 75 which had already gathered to listen to
a local DJ spin high powered hip-hop and techno swelled to about a 125 after
seeing the 2 pro's huck their meat. The location of the event was ideal for
competitor and spectator alike as it was in close proximity to TC's 6-person
chair, which allowed one to enjoy the other. Once all was fastened, buckled,
tightened, and greased, the boarders were run first. To simplify the judging
criterion and still keep an equitable system flags were used to determine
which competitor advanced. The 3 judges each had a blue and a red flag and
competitors were run in a dual format judged on technical merit, difficulty,
and amplitude.
<P>
In the skier pool, which had just as many competitors, the Japanese ruled.
With the likes of up and coming stars Taisuke Kusunoki and Yuki Kadota making
it to the finals, the last dual of the day was huge!!! Taisuke, a 15-year
old school boy from Japan, was throwing huge 720 grabs and going the biggest
anyone went all season. Yuki, who also competed in the Pulsate Wanaka Big
Air, flawlessly threw lincoln loops and misty 720'swith one of his huge laid
out front flips to win it. Overall, the event was awesome. Judges, competitors,
and spectators had a great day in the warm winter sun of New Zealand.
<P>
August 7th Supercross
<P>
August 7th saw the first combined skier/boarder Supercross in the Saddle
at TC. With the help of the TC cat drivers, we were able to build quite a
harrowing course. Right out of the gates were 2 huge rollers and then a sharp
right turn, which was extremely effective in separating the pack. Following
the start the course swooped down into one of TCs natural half pipes. The
half pipe consisted of four banked turns followed by a step-up jump. After
the jump there were three more banked turns to a straightaway with several
rollers allowing riders to launch from one to another. Several of the skiers
cleared the last two leading down into the finish.&nbsp;Kiwi, Sam Hazeldine,
demonstrated his skiing prowess by edging out Sam Hall and Josh Loubek to
take first place. Local, Lizzie Spencer won the women skiers and the men
and women's boarder final was an all-Japanese final.
<P>
September 17 Big Air
<P>
Due to adverse conditions the Slopestyle, originally scheduled for the 20th
of August, was re-scheduled to the 17th of September. Unfortunately, by the
17th, 2 of the 4 hits in the terrain park had become unrideable, so we decided
to make the competition a Big Air. The competitors were given 4 runs with
the combined score of the two best runs advancing to the final. Women boarders
Pip Grant and Romy Kaiser threw some nice straight air grabs and were awarded
with a pair of Fate pants and New Zealand Freeskier Camp t-shirts. The 6
men that advanced to the boarders' finals shredded.
<P>
Winner Ollie Burke said," This event went off. It was a perfect day to come
out and huck in the Spring sun and snow."
