Here you will find coverage on all of the comps in the Twin Cities that I
can make it to and some out of the Twin Cities. I will try hard to make it
to as many as I can. Then I will do a write up on the event and have the
top placements along with anyone that I know there. Pictures of Me and some
of the pros. Hope to have some AVI files that I can upload of the winning
run and stuff. well this place should just rule so check back often. If you
want to write some thing look at the link below.&nbsp;Thanks in advance if
you do. You will get credit. You may also do one already done.
